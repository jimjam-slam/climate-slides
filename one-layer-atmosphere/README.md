# One layer atmosphere



A (very) simple model of the Earth and the Sun.

A simple black body Earth with no atmosphere has a radiant temperature of about -15 °C.

When we add a single-layer atmosphere to let through solar radiation and intercepted infrared radiation, we get a radiant temperature closer to +15 °C.
