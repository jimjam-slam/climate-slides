# climate-slides
Animated, open source slides illustrating climate science. Drop 'em into your next presentation.

Slides are available in the PowerPoint format (`.pptx`) with a combination of automatic and 'on click' animations designed to walk an audience through the depicted process, but if you need the slides for other uses, they're also available in `.png`, `.pdf` and `.mov` formats.

This is still very tentative, but I'm super interested in contributions and collaborations (especially from artists who're interested in climate science!). Make a PR, or [get in touch with me](mailto:me@rensa.co) if you're still new to GitHub.

## Slides
